WARNING :   DEPRECATED FEATURE: flwr.server.start_server() is deprecated.
        Instead, use the `flower-superlink` CLI command to start a SuperLink as shown below:

                $ flower-superlink --insecure

        To view usage and all available options, run:

                $ flower-superlink --help

        Using `start_server()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
